     All derived classes must implement these and only these public functions (because
     of the way that pointers to this base class are used in the code, only these
     functions are available in the bulk of the code)

     If the underlying data struture
     has a notion of 'order' then the particles are garunteed to be in that
     structure in the order they were added

     Typical life cycle:
     
     -initialize wrapper
     -loop over particles
     --open particle
     --set values
     --close particles
     -finalize wrapper
